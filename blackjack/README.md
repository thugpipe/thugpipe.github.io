Blackjack is played with an international 52-card deck without jokers. The object of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without exceeding 21 points. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.

The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points whichever is more advantageous to the player.

At the start of a blackjack game, the player and the dealer receive two cards each. The dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down (called the hole card).

The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack" and the player holding this automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack. If a player and the dealer each have a blackjack, the result is a "push" for that player. If the dealer has a blackjack, all players not holding a blackjack lose.

Once the cards are dealt you can choose to hit or stay, however if your score exceeds 21 you will bust and the dealer will win.

If you stay the dealer will then draw cards until his score is greater than or equal to 17.  If the dealer has Blackjack (Ace + 10) with his two cards, he won't take any more cards. You lose, except if you also have a Blackjack, in which case it is a push.  If the dealer doesn't have a blackjack, he hits (takes more cards) or stands depending on the value of the hand. Contrary to the player, though, the dealer's action is completely dictated by the rules. The dealer must hit if the value of the hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand.  The dealer must also hit on a soft 17 (a hand of 17 containing an ace being counted as 11).
